# Hackcamp2023-MindMatch

HackCamp, a 12-hour hackathon hosted by NwPlus for beginners, focuses on community-driven projects. Our team's choice was to create a platform offering personalized professional help for various mental illnesses and marginalized groups. Recognizing that seeking help is already a challenging experience, we aimed to ensure that finding a therapist should not add an additional burden. For instance, individuals from racial minorities should effortlessly locate professionals who understand their perspectives, and members of the LGBTQ+ community should easily connect with accepting therapists. Our website empowers users to select topics they seek help for, matching them with professionals specializing in those specific areas.

Due to time constraints during the hackathon, we utilized hard-coded information to test our application's functionality. Looking forward, our goal is to integrate a backend server with real specialist information. This enhancement will transform the platform into a resource that can be utilized by those in need of support. Overall this project was a great learning experience, as we learned about the DOM, styling, and how to use tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
